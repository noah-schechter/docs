We're eager to build a community of developers around the Atlos project. If you're interested in contributing to Atlos, please reach out at [contact@atlos.org](mailto:contact@atlos.org). 

You can find our development, architecture, and deployment guide [here](https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos/blob/main/platform/README.md). We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos/issues) for issue-tracking; you can find a list of good first issues [here](https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
