# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

Open source investigations thrive in large investigative communities. We think Atlos shines as a home for this type of large-scale collaboration. 

## How to add a member 
To add a member to a project: 
1. Navigate to the Projects page on the left sidebar menu.
2. Select the relevant project. 
3. Naviage to the Members tab, which is visible only to project owners.
4. Click the `Add member` button. 
5. Add one member at a time by entering their username, choosing a role, and pressing `Add member`. 

When adding a new member, choose each collaborator’s role carefully. Members’ roles dictate their editing permissions and data access. You can learn more about roles and permissions below.

## How to change an existing member’s role
Navigate to the Members tab (which is visible only to owners [hyperlink to owner article]) of your project. Press the Edit button on the member whose role you want to change. Choose the member’s new role from the drop-down menu.

## Roles & permissions
There are four roles on Atlos. We’ve listed them below, in order of decreasing authority.

### Owner
Owners wield ultimate authority over a project. Consult with all collaborators before granting an Owner role to an investigator. Project owners can:
- Add and remove members 
- Delete the project 
- Change a project’s attributes 
- Change a project’s title, description, and identification code
- Bulk import data
- Mark incidents as complete
- Edit all incidents, including those already marked as complete 
- View and comment on incidents
- View deleted incidents
- Bulk export data

### Manager
Managers facilitate collaboration on Atlos. Project administrators are often given the Manager role. Managers can:
- Mark incidents as complete
- Edit all incidents, including those marked as complete
- View and comment on incidents
- View deleted incidents
- Bulk export data
- Editor
- Editors are standard contributors to projects. Editors can:
- Edit all incidents (except those marked as completed)
- View and comment on incidents
- Bulk export data

### Viewer
Viewers can only view and comment on incidents; they cannot edit project data. Viewer is the most restrictive role on Atlos. Use this role to share data from a completed investigation with outside collaborators. Viewers can:
- View and comment on incidents
- Bulk export data


{% callout %}
Data on Atlos is often sensitive. We recommend following a **minimum access policy** to protect your investigation. A minimum access policy restricts each researcher to the lowest level of access to privileged information and permissions needed to perform their work. 
On Atlos, a minimum access policy means that, for example, an investigator joining a project only so that they can view data should be granted a Viewer role, not a role that gives them edit access. TODO: add citation/links
