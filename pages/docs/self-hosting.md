# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

Our hosted instance of Atlos provides two benefits to our users:
- **Convenience—** Atlos is a fully-featured web application that requires significant technical ability to host and maintain. For the vast majority of investigators, it's easiest to just make an account and get started.
- **Network effect—** All investigators on our instance of Atlos can collaborate easily—all they have to do is type in another investigators username to add a colleague to a new investigation. 

If you're willing to host your own instance and you don't care about collaborating with the broader network of Atlos investigators (for example, because you're hosting Atlos exclusviely for your own organiztion), we encourage you to self-host. You can find our development, architecture, and deployment guide [here](https://github.com/atlosdotorg/atlos/blob/main/platform/README.md). If you have any questions about self-hosting, please reach out to [contact@atlos.org](mailto:contact@atlos.org).
