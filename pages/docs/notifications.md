The Notifications page displays a newest-first feed of updates to and comments on incidents to which you’re subscribed.

## Subscriptions
Here’s what you need to know about subscriptions:
- **Automatic subscriptions—** Atlos automatically subscribes you to an incident if you comment on it or update any of its Attributes or Metadata. 
- **Manual subscriptions—** To subscribe to (or unsubscribe from) any incident, click `Subscribe` (or `Subscribed`, if you’re unsubscribing) on the top-right corner of the incident page. 
- **Viewing subscriptions—** To view all of your Subscriptions, navigate to the Notifications page and click the `View and manage subscriptions` button on the right side of the window. 
- **Bulk unsubscribing—** To unsubscribe from many incidents, navigate to the My Subscriptions page by clicking the `View and manage subscriptions` button on the right side of the Notifications page. Then hover over the top-right corner of an incident’s card and click `Unsubscribe`. Incidents that you’ve unsubscribed to on this page will become transparent; once you reload this page they’ll disappear from your list of Subscriptions. If you unsubscribe to an incident in error on the My Subscriptions page, you can easily undo the change by clicking the `Resubscribe` button in the top-right corner of the incident’s card.
