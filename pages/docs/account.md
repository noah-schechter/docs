## Profile 
Your profile is visible to all Atlos users. It includes your username, profile photo, bio, a list of the projects of which you’re a member, and a feed of your recent updates. Investigators on Atlos will only be able to see updates and projects on your profile that they would otherwise have access to—if someone is not a member of a project, they won’t see your update to an incident in that project just because they navigated to your profile page. 

### Edit your profile 
To edit your bio or profile image, navigate to the Account page by clicking Account on the bottom of the left sidebar menu. Remember to press Save after making changes to your profile. 

To edit your username or email address, please email the Atlos team at contact@atlos.org. 

### View your profile
To view your profile, navigate to the Account page by clicking Account on the bottom of the left sidebar menu. Then press View my profile and activity on the Profile pane. 

## Password reset
To change your password, navigate to the Account page by clicking Account on the bottom of the left sidebar menu. Then click the Change password button on the Account and Security pane. Your current password is necessary to change your password; if you’ve forgotten your password and are attempting to change it while logged in, log out and complete the password reset process below.

If you have forgotten your password, click Reset password on the login page. Enter your email address, complete the captcha, click Send instructions, and follow the instructions you receive in your inbox. 

## Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
We strongly recommend that all users enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their Atlos account. To enable MFA, navigate to the Account page by clicking Account on the bottom of the left sidebar menu. Then click the Multi-factor auth button on the Account and Security pane.
