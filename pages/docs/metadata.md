Metadata is used for coordinating workflows on Atlos. There are four elements to Metadata:

## Status 
Status refers to the status of an incident in the investigative workflow. Options include:
Unclaimed—Not actively being worked on. Unclaimed incidents are the best places to start contributing to a project. 
- **In Progress—** Actively being worked on. Check in with the researcher who claimed an incident before contributing. Access this information by clicking on the profile image next to Status, or by clicking History after selecting Update next to Status.
- **Help Needed—** Stuck, or ready for a second opinion. Be sure to explain why you’re marking an incident as Help Needed so other researchers know where you need help.
- **Ready for Review—** Ready for a moderator’s verification. This applies to incidents where all applicable attributes have been updated. 
- **Completed—** Investigation complete. A moderator will mark an incident as ‘Completed’ once they’ve verified an incident’s attributes. Marking an incident as Completed seals the incident’s data so that only project owners and managers can edit it. 
- **Canceled—** Will not be completed (out of scope, duplicate, etc.). A moderator will mark an incident as ‘Canceled’ if it’s not relevant or if it’s a duplicate of an existing incident. Marking an incident as Completed seals the incident’s data so that only project owners and managers can edit it. 

## Sensitivity 
Atlos takes safety seriously. To ensure investigators’ safety, every incident must have a sensitivity value. We use this sensitivity value to communicate media’s sensitivity to investigators before they view it, because researchers are less likely to be traumatized by graphic content when they know what to expect. If content is graphic, we also display a clickthrough to further prevent inadvertent exposures. 

When archiving source material, it is important to take into account the safety of your fellow researchers. If you suspect that an incident contains graphic or disturbing source material, be sure to reflect that in its Sensitivity.

Sensitivity options include:
- **Not Sensitive—** Nothing is potentially graphic or sensitive in the source material of the incident
- **Personal Information Visible—** The incident’s source material includes information that could be used to identify individuals. For example, if a video of a potential human rights violation is shot from a window of an apartment, the video could be used to geolocate the apartment. In repressive states, this can lead to the individuals filming the incident to be punished severely by the local administration as the people living in the apartment were most likely the people who filmed the incident. Publishing the material further might pose a danger for the individuals’ privacy or safety.
- **Graphic Violence—** The incident’s source material contains potentially distressing material. Viewer discretion is advised.
- **Deleted by Source—** The incident’s source material has been deleted by the source.
- **Deceptive or Misleading—** The incident’s source material includes information that has been found to be deceptive.

## Tags 
Tags are used for grouping incidents. To add a new tag, type a new label and press Enter in the tag search bar. 

Only project owners and managers can add and update tags. 

## Restrictions 
Atlos offers several tools for moderating viewing and editing access to individual incidents. We recommend that you use these incident-level tools only when Atlos' project-level access controls are insufficient.

### Freezing
Freezing an incident prevents viewers and editors from editing a incident's attributes, metadata, and source material. Project managers and owners can still edit a Frozen incident's data.

{% callout type="caution" %}
We encourage you to not use this restriction as a means of sealing data when an investigation is completed (as a replacement for marking incidents as [Complete](/docs/metadata#status)). Use Frozen as an emergency moderation tool in extreme cases, not as a standard part of your workflow.
{% /callout %}
#### How to freeze an incident
To freeze an incident, project managers and owners can click the `Update` button in the Restrictions row of the Metadata pane. Add the Frozen restriction and click `Post update`.

### Hiding
Hiding an incident prevents viewers and editors from viewing an incident. Hidden incidents will not apepar in viewers' and editors' searches, homepages, notifications, or exports. Project managers and owners will still be able to view hidden incidents in their searches, homepages, notifications, and exports. 

#### How to hide an incident
To hide an incident, project managers and owners can click the `Update` button in the Restrictions row of the Metadata pane. Add the Hidden restriction and click `Post update`.
