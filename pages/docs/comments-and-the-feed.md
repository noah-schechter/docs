The Feed is the home for incident-level collaboration on Atlos. It’s also a detailed changelog modeled after GitHub and Wikipedia. This section is a brief overview of the feed’s core functions.

## Change-tracking
When any investigator makes any change to an incident’s data—by adding new source material, updating an attribute, or editing its Status—their change will appear in the feed. If the investigator included an explanation for their change, this explanation will immediately follow the change in the feed. 

## Comments
If an investigator wants to respond to a change or start a new conversation, they can leave a comment in the feed.

## File upload
Geolocations often involve reference imagery; to upload images or other files to comments, click the [paperclip icon] in the bottom-left corner of the text box. 

## Tagging
To tag another investigator in a comment, type “@” followed by their username.

## Moderation tools
If a user posts sensitive content that other investigators shouldn’t be able to view, project owners can click the small Hide button above any comment to hide it from view. Hiding a comment will restrict its visibility so that only other project owners can still see it.
